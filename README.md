As a Data Engineer, there are several tasks that you need to do that is :

1. Perform Import/Restore Database Staging.
2. Create a Database named DWH_Project, as well create Fact and Dimension   Tables from existing tables in staging database.
3. Create an ETL Job in the talend application to move data from Staging to Data Warehouse. Especially for Tables DimCustomer, perform data transformation    by changing data from the FirstName and LastName columns to capital letters all, then concatenate the two columns into one column named CustomerName. 
4. Create a Store Procedure (SP) to display summary sales order based on delivery status.


On this repository I have SQL Querry for create Tables. I also have backup database for Staging and my new database DWH_Project.
